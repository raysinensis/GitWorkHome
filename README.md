# GitWorkHome
For batch controls of multiple git repositories.

Place the sh file in the git master fold, and execute: $ sh GitWorkHome.sh + option (gc, status, pull, etc), to process each command on all subfolders.

use zip option to archive each folder as a .zip file with date in the file name

script now also automatically checks last gc time (git recommends running the clean up often), and prompts clean up

More functions to come.
